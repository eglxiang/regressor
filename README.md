## OSVR

Ordinal Support Vector Regression (OSVR) is a general purpose regression model that takes data samples as well as their pairwise ordinal relation as input and output the model parameters learned from data under the max-margin framework. Label (regression response) of each individual sample is not required. OSVR can adapt from no supervision (no labels) to full supervision (labels on all samples). In particular, OSVR can be very useful under weak supervision, where only labels on selected key samples are provided. However, ordinal information should always be available under different supervision settings. Current version 1.0 only supports linear regression model.

## How to use

This repository provides an implementation of OSVR in Matlab. The core optimization problem is solved using customized Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). However, the 'admm' function is implemented general enough to handle an optimization problem with standard form. See related publication for more details.

To see an example, run 'main' script. The sample data provided correspond to one testing fold of UNBC-McMaster shoulder pain dataset [1]. Please contact author if you need more data for comparison purpose.
